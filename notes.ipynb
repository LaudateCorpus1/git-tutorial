    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is version control and why should I care?\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply, a version control system (VCS) (a.k.a. revision or source\n",
    "control) is a system that tracks and manages changes to a set of data\n",
    "(e.g. source code). The [Emacs\n",
    "website](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Introduction-to-VC.html)\n",
    "summarises VCS by three capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Reversibility: the ability to back up to a previous state if you\n",
    "    discover that some modification you did was a mistake or a bad idea.\n",
    "-   Concurrency: the ability to have many people modifying the same\n",
    "    collection of files knowing that conflicting modifications can be\n",
    "    detected and resolved.\n",
    "-   History: the ability to attach historical data to your data, such as\n",
    "    explanatory comments about the intention behind each change. Even\n",
    "    for a programmer working solo, change histories are an important aid\n",
    "    to memory; for a multi-person project, they are a vitally important\n",
    "    form of communication among developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you are writing a report; instead of renaming different versions of\n",
    "files `report.tex`, `report_final.tex`, `report_FINAL.tex`,\n",
    "`report_FINALFINAL.tex`, `report_FINAL_abcdef.tex`, ad infinitum,\n",
    "version control systems allow you to save the entire history of a file\n",
    "as a series of staged changes, often called commits or revisions. This\n",
    "may not seem so useful for a linear process such as a single person\n",
    "writing a document, but for the non-linear process of software\n",
    "development, version control is a must. Every single serious software\n",
    "project exists under some form of version control, almost by definition.\n",
    "Learning effective version control is a vital skill, not just for\n",
    "careers in the tech industry, but also for producing sustainable\n",
    "software and thus reproducible science.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this tutorial is to teach basic concepts of version control\n",
    "that you might consider using for the coursework. A few hours of\n",
    "investment, and maybe some moments of confusion, will hopefully lead to\n",
    "a productivity boost. We shall work with the Git (`git`) version control\n",
    "system as, at the time of writing this, it dominates the market with\n",
    "Subversion (`svn`) and Mercurial (`hg`) lagging behind (as evidenced by\n",
    "[Google trends](https://g.co/trends/CECvA)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Git?\n",
    "\n",
    "Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 <sup href='#git'>\\[1\\]</sup>\n",
    "to manage the source code of the Linux kernel, with the requirements\n",
    "that it be fast, distributed and secure. At the time, the Linux kernel\n",
    "was 6 million lines long <sup href=#lines>\\[2\\]</sup>, with thousands of\n",
    "developers worldwide <sup href='#devs'>\\[3\\]</sup>; whilst famous for\n",
    "creating Linux, many argue that Git is Linus Torvalds’ greatest\n",
    "technical achievement.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git` is an example of what is called a distributed version control\n",
    "system. This means that there is no “master copy” of a project, and\n",
    "instead the entire history of a project is mirrored on the computer of\n",
    "every developer (and potentially user). This becomes extremely useful\n",
    "when multiple people are actively developing a project for reasons we\n",
    "shall touch on later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git has somewhat of a reputation for being difficult to learn and\n",
    "master, due its 21 different subcommands, and their myriad options. Most\n",
    "simple use cases, however, require only a few of these commands. A\n",
    "complete and in-depth documentation of their operation can be found at\n",
    "the command-line by running `git help <subcommand>`, whilst a brief\n",
    "summary on the subsection of Git that we will discuss can be found in\n",
    "the [cheatsheet](#basic-subcommand-cheatsheet) in the appendix. Several\n",
    "graphical user interfaces (GUIs) also exist for Git, which you may\n",
    "prefer, though I do not have one to recommend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without going into detail, Git calculates *hashes*\n",
    "(SHA-1<sup href='#sha1'>\\[4\\]</sup>) of the files it tracks and uses\n",
    "them to quickly compare files. The files themselves are compressed and\n",
    "stored as changes relative to one another (even so, the `.git` folder\n",
    "can become rather large). If you are interested in what Git is doing\n",
    "under the hood, have a look at [Chapter 10 of Pro\n",
    "Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a repository?\n",
    "\n",
    "A repository (or repo) is a top-level directory of files and directories\n",
    "that is managed by a version control system, containing e.g. the source\n",
    "of an entire software project. Often, the term repository refers to a\n",
    "location on a remote server that maintains a central copy of the project\n",
    "that developers can push changes in their *local repository* to, and\n",
    "pull other people’s changes from. All of the project history is stored\n",
    "in the `.git` folder at the top-level of the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, developers would often directly push to or pull from each\n",
    "other’s local repositories, but nowadays most projects will host their\n",
    "VCS on either a private server, or trust of the many web-based version\n",
    "control service providers. The main players in this field are\n",
    "[GitHub](https://www.github.com), [BitBucket](https://www.bitbucket.org)\n",
    "and [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com), which each provide similar web\n",
    "interfaces to Git (or otherwise) repositories. These web services are\n",
    "very useful to individual users who don’t want to run their own server,\n",
    "and in fact this very tutorial is hosted on\n",
    "[GitHub](https://www.github.com/ml-evs/git-tutorial). Open source\n",
    "software has really benefited from these web-facing services that\n",
    "provide centralised, discoverable web pages for projects, as well as\n",
    "ways to talk to and raise issues with developers, lowering the bar to\n",
    "making contributions yourself. Additionally, web-based services allow\n",
    "for the automation of many useful checks on software, as we shall see in\n",
    "the [test-driven development](#test-driven-development) section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each provider has its own advantages and disadvantages to consider but\n",
    "for our usage they are all broadly similar (and all allow unlimited\n",
    "private repos for free, often providing extra benefits for students\n",
    "\\[5\\]). One of the useful features of distributed VCS is that you can\n",
    "easily transfer your entire code history to a different provider, since\n",
    "you are constantly mirroring your own version of the project locally\n",
    "\\[6\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a commit?\n",
    "\n",
    "A commit (a.k.a. revision, changeset) is a set of file modifications\n",
    "grouped under the same user-provided descriptive comment and a\n",
    "randomly-generated hash, providing a snapshot in time of the entire\n",
    "repository. It’s important to note that commits stack on top of each\n",
    "other (in the sense of stack memory: last in, first out).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some practical questions you might ask about commits:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   How often should I commit?\n",
    "    -   The changes to code that you commit can be as fine or\n",
    "        coarse-grained as necessary, depending on personal preference.\n",
    "    -   When writing a new code, the first commit might not occur until\n",
    "-   What makes a good commit message?\n",
    "    -   Simply a short description of the changes made. For example,\n",
    "        good messages include “fixed typo in example.cpp”, “added\n",
    "        diffraction plotting function”, “got ODE solver working” and\n",
    "        “attempted second example”, but “fixed example”, “added\n",
    "        function”, “code now working” and “end of first practical” are\n",
    "        less good. If you want to write a long description, write a\n",
    "        short description as the first line, then use new lines to add\n",
    "        detail.\n",
    "-   Can I edit previous commits?\n",
    "    -   You can edit the last commit, before pushing, using\n",
    "        `git commit     --amend`, but not any older commits.\n",
    "-   Can I undo a commit?\n",
    "    -   You can revert *to* a commit, so you can “undo” the most recent\n",
    "        commit, but you can’t undo an older commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Worked examples\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find these examples easier to follow online, where text can be\n",
    "copied more easily: <https://www.github.com/ml-evs/git-tutorial>.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "First things first, check that you have Git installed on the machine\n",
    "you’re using for these tutorials. On Linux/\\*nix (including Windows\n",
    "Subsystem for Linux), at the command-line:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git --version\n",
    "    git version 2.20.1\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Windows directly, you need Git installed to reach this\n",
    "shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing to do is register who you are to Git:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git config --global user.name \"<your_name_here>\"\n",
    "    $ git config --global user.email \"<your_email_here>\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1.1: A Contrived Example of a Local Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will make a local Git repository, add some files to\n",
    "it, commit them, make some changes, then commit the changes. Very\n",
    "exciting. First, make a new folder and tell Git that you want it to be a\n",
    "repository:\n",
